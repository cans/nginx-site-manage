nginx-site-manage
=================

A Role to manage nginx "sites" (virtual hosts configuration).

A lot of distributions allow for managing virtual hosts configuration
via symbolic links between a directory where configuration files are
stored, and another from which they are loaded. One can then easily
enable or disable a configuration by adding or removing as symlink to
the file in the former directory into the latter one. This is the kind
of setup this role deals with.


Describing the sites to install
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Each site is describe as follows:

```yaml
- site_template: "<path to a configuration file template>"
  site_name: "<name of the site>"
  site_state: "enabled"  # Either enabled or disabled
  # Add any additional key your template requires here.
  # They will be available to the template as `{{item.<key>}}`
```

This roles comes with a few basic templates, for simple use
cases, you can expand on. See the example playbooks below for more.

Note that for example, you can use templates from outside the role:

```yaml
- site_template: "{{play_dir}}/templates/nginx/my-template.j2"
  site_name: "my-site"
  site_state: "disabled"
  some_extra_variable: "this role does not care"
```

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
     - role: "cans.nginx-site-manage"
       nginxsites_sites_present:
         - site_name: hello
           site_template: "proxied-site.j2"  # Use built-in configuration template.
           site_state: "disabled"
           site_ip: "127.0.0.1"
           site_port: 8080
       nginxsites_sites_absent:
         - site_name: default
           # site remove only cares about the site name.
           # But you could have more variables defined here.
	   # Removing an existing site is a easy as cutting
	   # its description off of the `nginxsites_sites_absent` list
	   # and pasting it into the `nginxsites_sites_present` one.
```
